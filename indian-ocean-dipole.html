                            in my primary school years, we used to get rainfall almost throughout the year. I loved it
                            when it was raining. Everything about the rainy seasons felt good from the flourishing
                            gardens, playing with pools of water together with my little brothers, not to mention the
                            warm rainy nights. With climate change, a lot has changed and we no longer enjoy rains
                            throughout the year as we used to.

                        <p class="text-justify">
                            The year 2019 was very dry in the beginning and this condition extended into the month of
                            April when the heavy rains normally start in Kenya. The rains started in May but did not
                            last long enough. However, mid that year we started experiencing rains that lasted up to the
                            end of the year. The rains were consistent and some parts of the country experienced floods.
                            This did not go unnoticed by me out of my ever present concern about the weather.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-justify">
                            We ushered in 2020 and the rains kept on falling. I was particularly happy with the
                            consistency of these rains. During that year, there was a locust infestation in the Eastern
                            Africa region. I was reading an article (can’t remember its name) on this locust infestation
                            when I first saw the concept of the Indian Ocean Dipole and it really sparked interest in
                            me. This concept helped me understand the reason behind the ‘ideal’ climate that we had been
                            experiencing since mid-2019 up to and including the whole of 2020.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="text-justify">The Indian Ocean Dipole</h3>

                        <p class="text-justify">
                            The oceans play an important role in determining the weather and climate of the earth. They
                            are the source of most of the water that falls on land as rain. In simple terms, when the
                            surface of the ocean gets heated, water evaporates and it rises up to form clouds that later
                            fall as rain.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-justify">
                            The Indian Ocean Dipole is a condition that occurs when there is difference in surface
                            temperatures of the opposite sides (Eastern and Western) of the Indian Ocean. The dipole is
                            either positive, negative or neutral. A positive dipole occurs when the temperatures of the
                            ocean are higher on the western parts of the ocean compared to the eastern parts. A negative
                            dipole is the opposite of the positive dipole i.e. higher temperatures in the eastern parts
                            of the Indian Ocean compared to western parts. A neutral dipole occurs when the temperatures
                            on the eastern and western sides are relatively the same.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-justify">
                            Africa lies to the West of the Indian Ocean and Australia to the East. This means that the
                            dipoles play a major role in determining the rainfall patterns of these two land masses.
                            When the ocean surface is warmer on one side, the neighboring land masses are more likely to
                            experience high amounts of rain while the land masses neighboring the colder side are likely
                            to experience dry conditions.
                        </p>


                        <h3 class="text-justify">The positive dipole</h3>

                        <p class="text-justify">
                            The positive dipole is associated with increased chance of rain in the Eastern Africa region
                            and increased chance of dry conditions in East and South-Eastern Australia. Around mid-2019,
                            we had a positive dipole that led to increased rain in the Eastern Africa region and dry
                            conditions in Australia followed by intense bush fires. The dipole peaked at around October
                            seeing continued wet season in the Eastern Africa region with some places experiencing
                            floods. The rainy conditions extended throughout 2020 in the Eastern Africa region with
                            Australia recording below average rainfall nationally. This positive dipole is the strongest
                            in six decades hence the extreme conditions on either side of the Indian Ocean.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="text-justify">The negative dipole</h3>


                        <p class="text-justify">
                            The negative dipole occurs when the eastern parts of the Indian Ocean are warmer compared to
                            the western parts. This results in an increased chance of rain in the Australian side and
                            reduced chance of rain in the Eastern Africa side. The eastern parts of the Indian Ocean
                            have been relatively warmer compared to those on the western parts in 2021 and this explains
                            the low rainfall levels in the Eastern Africa region. On the other hand, the Australian side
                            has been receiving above average rainfall this year.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="text-justify">Conclusion</h3>

                        <p class="text-justify">
                            The Indian Ocean Dipole plays an important role in determining the rainfall patterns of the
                            Eastern Africa region and Australia. The Indian Ocean Dipole is similar to the El Nino and
                            La Nina experienced in the Pacific Ocean.
