                    </h2>


                    <h3 class="text-justify"> Introduction</h3>

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Climate change and human encroachment are a major threat to ecosystems around the world
                        especially in the tropics. The tropics are characterized with one of the richest biodiversity on
                        the planet. This means that the effects of climate change will be felt most in ecosystems found
                        within the tropics. Urgent conservation efforts need to be increased in order to preserve these
                        ecosystems.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Increase in temperatures due to global warming and habitat loss due to human encroachment is
                        greatly affecting bird populations. It is estimated that over the next 100 years, 20 percent to
                        30 percent of bird species will be extinct. Majority of these are birds found in the tropics. As
                        temperatures rise and habitats are lost, animals tend to migrate in search of new and cool
                        habitats. By studying these trends, we can learn about the changes taking place in the
                        ecosystems.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Birds respond quickly to changes taking place in their ecosystems. This makes them to be one of
                        the most suitable species to use as an indicator of the changes taking place in ecosystems. We
                        can infer about other species within a given ecosystem by studying the trends of bird species. A
                        decline or absence of a bird species that used to be found in a given ecosystem would indicate a
                        change in that ecosystem hence calling for its conservation.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-justify">Monitoring ecosystems</h3>

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Current trends in ecosystems call for them to be closely monitored in order to preserve them.
                        Traditional methods of monitoring the ecosystems that involve carrying out surveys are time
                        consuming, expensive and are sometimes affected by other factors like inaccessibility of some
                        parts and weather. Therefore, alternative and better methods of monitoring the ecosystems need
                        to be devised.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Bioacoustic monitoring of ecosystems provides a potential remedy to the hurdles faced when using
                        surveys to monitor ecosystems. Most animals, like human beings, use sound as one of their means
                        of communication. It is possible to identify different bird species by the sound they produce.
                        This means that we can monitor birds by listening to the sound they make.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Advancement in technology has seen development of handheld devices that can be used to record
                        good quality sound. Using these devices, we can collect acoustic data in ecosystems of interest
                        and use it in studying the species found in them. The AudioMoth and the Raspberry Pi are
                        examples of devices that can be used in collecting acoustic data for ecosystems monitoring.
                        Figure 1 below shows the AudioMoth and the Raspberry Pi.

                    <h3 class="text-justify">Automatic acoustic classification of bird species.</h3>

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Acoustic monitoring of ecosystems provides a means to study ecosystems with minimal disturbance
                        and over wide areas. Decrease in cost of recording instruments has made it easier to expand
                        acoustic monitoring of ecosystems from just proof of concept studies to actual study of
                        biodiversity. Acoustic sensors can be deployed in most parts of the ecosystems to record sound
                        that is then used to study the ecosystems.
                    </p>


                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Ecosystems have a vast amount of acoustic data that can be used to study trends in them. Manual
                        analysis of this data may prove to be cumbersome and time consuming. Sampling of the data may
                        introduce bias and incompleteness in the analysis. However, use of acoustic sensors with the
                        ability to classify species automatically from their vocalization can help solve this problem.
                        Automatic acoustic classification of birds leverages digital signal processing and machine
                        learning techniques to classify different species based on their vocalizations.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Birds are one of the most vocal species in the ecosystems. The sound produced by a bird contains
                        features that are unique to its species. Using digital signal processing, we can extract these
                        features and identify different species from the sound they produce. The feature of interest in
                        acoustic classification is the frequency component of the sound.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Python programming language makes it possible to carry out digital signal processing in
                        software. The frequency components of a sound recording can be extracted and plotted against
                        time using Python. This plot is called a spectrogram. Figure 2 below shows spectrograms of the

                        From figure 2, we can see the plots are different from each other. Therefore, we can classify
                        birds by extracting the frequency component of their sound and plotting a spectrogram. The
                        spectrogram can then be treated as an image and fed to a machine learning model as an input for
                        classification.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Severe degradation of ecosystems has affected different species negatively around the world.
                        Conservation efforts need to be increased to preserve these ecosystems. Birds are one of the
                        best species to use when studying the ecosystems since they respond quickly to changes taking
                        place in the ecosystems. Automatic acoustic classification of birds provides a tool to
                        continuously monitor ecosystems. Using the data obtained from the acoustic systems, we can study
                        the trends of bird species in ecosystems of interest and infer about the states of these
                        ecosystems.
